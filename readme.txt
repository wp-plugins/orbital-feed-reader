Read where you write. Orbital integrates a feed reader into WordPress. Blog directly from your feeds!

== Description ==

Feed readers turn the internet into a better place, but most of them are either hosted by someone else or they are tied to the desktop. With Orbital you can own your feeds, right in your WordPress admin panel.

Even better, because it is integrated into WordPress, you can reblog the great stuff you find and share it faster. Post better content, more often, by reducing the friction between where you read and where you write.

== Installation ==

Just as simple as you'd expect. 

1. Upload the Orbital Feed Reader directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Orbital will add a few sample feeds and instructional entries to get you started. Click the `+` sign to add your favorites or import an OPML file.
