    <p>If you are looking for a way to edit the names or members of your feeds, click the pencil icon (âœŽ) on the feed list.</p>
    <p>You can <a href="<?php echo site_url("?export_opml=".get_current_user_id())  ?>">export your feed list in OPML format</a> at any time. If you are logged in, you'll get your <b>private</b> feeds in there. If you aren't logged in, the same link will filter out private feeds. This is useful if you want to move your list to another feed reader. </p>
    <p><small>If they don't give you this same option, maybe think twice about using that kind of software.</small></p>
